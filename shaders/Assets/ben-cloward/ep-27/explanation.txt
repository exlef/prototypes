Understanding the Sharpening Effect
Before Division:

The result of the Dot Product is a smooth gradient (e.g., from 0 to 1) based on the alignment between the transformed normal and some reference vector (like Up or Forward).
This gradient is soft because it represents the degree of alignment in a linear way.
Division Process:

When you divide the Dot Product output by a smaller number (or by another value that acts like a control), it effectively scales up the higher values while pushing the lower values closer to zero. This boosts the steepness of the gradient.
For example:
Original Dot Product range: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8.
After dividing by 0.5: 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6.
This scaling increases the contrast, making the transition sharper.
Why It Sharpens the Mask:

The division creates a nonlinear transformation of the values.
Values near 0 are further suppressed (made smaller), and values near 1 are boosted more significantly.
This enhances the visibility of aligned directions (e.g., surfaces that closely match the reference vector) while diminishing misaligned regions.
Controlling the Sharpness
The sharpness of the mask can be controlled by:

The divisor value:
Smaller divisor = Sharper mask (more contrast).
Larger divisor = Softer mask (less contrast).
Adding a Power node before Division:
If you want even more control, use a Power node to apply an exponential effect before dividing. For example, raising values to a power <1 can further enhance contrast.
Practical Implications
Using division in this way is a common technique in shaders to:

Create sharp regions for procedural texturing.
Define clear masks for visual effects (e.g., edge highlights or directional masks).
Enhance artistic control over gradient transitions.
